## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've found a vulnerability in our components or website, or want additional information regarding how we manage security, please report it via a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/microcks/microcks/discussions).

In case you do not want to publicly report a security issue for one of the libraries owned by the Microcks community, write an email with a detailed description of the issue to security@microcks.io.
